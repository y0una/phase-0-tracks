1. Name at least three categories of CSS adjustments (example: colors)?
- background color, margin, text-align, width, font-family, line-height

2. What are the three ways to link a CSS rule to an HTML document? Which one is the best and why?
-  External Style Sheet: In the head section of the html file include a link to the name of the css style file by making it equal to an href “<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/>” This is the best way since changing one external style sheet file can change the entire look of the site.
- Internal Style Sheet: When a single document has a particular style we can include an internal style tag in the head of the html file itself and add css there “<head><style> …</style></head>”
- Inline styles: has the highest priority and will override all other styles. This is to be used only when really necessary since it doesn’t take advantage of style sheets
<div style="color:#999999; margin-left:10px;"><p>Lorem ipsum dolor paragraph.</p></div>

3. What is a selector? Give examples of at least three types of selectors.
- Selectors are patterns used to select the elements that we want to style. Ex: .class, #id, :hover, div > p (selects all p elements where parent is a div element)

4. What is the box model?
- Box model is a box that wraps around all HTML elements. First is the padding, then border, then margin

5. Explain and give an example of the cascading effect of CSS.
- Styles cascade into a digital style sheet from the 
Browser default styles,
Styles specified by a user who is reading document,  
External stylesheet by creator, 
Internal stylesheet by creator, and 
lastly inline style where inline style by creator.  
The viewers style changes the browser default style. The doc creator’s style then changes the style further

“5. The cascading effect of CSS means that if an element has multiple selectors that apply to it, and some of the rules within the selectors contradict each other, the rule of the most specific selector will be applied first. For example, all paragraphs on a page may be given a set of rules using “p” as a selector. This could appear as:
p {
  text-alignment: justify;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 10px;
}
Then, the developer may want the first paragraph to appear the same way, but with slightly larger text, so they include the following:
p:first-of-type {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}
Because the second selector is more specific than the first, and contradicts the “font-size” rule of the first, the cascading nature of CSS will override the font-size rule of the more general selector with the font-size rule of the more specific selector, while still inheriting all other non-contradicted rules from the more general selector.”

6. Name two CSS techniques that assist in responsive design.

- Max-width container can be specified for an element:
.container { width: 800px; max-width: 90%; } No matter what size it will only take up 90% of the width

- Min-width sets the minimum width to prevent elements from getting too small when scaled
.container{ min-width:140px}

- Relative Values (Margin, Font Size, Padding)
Percentages allow the css to scale down naturally
body {margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
max-width: 90%}

- Word break: the word-wrap property can make a single long text to wrap 
word-wrap:break-word;

“Two CSS techniques that assist in responsive design are performing media queries, and using percentages instead of pixel numbers. Media queries can be used to apply different rules to elements depending on the size of the screen that the content is being viewed on. This can be simple, such as changing the font-size of headings, or more complex changes, such as a whole new lay-out to the site, optimized for the narrow screens seen on smartphones. Using percentages instead of pixel numbers allows things to appear exactly the same way no matter the pixel size of the screen. This helps to preserve the intended look of a given layout.”
