Release 2: View a Many-to-Many Relationship

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

TEMPLATE TO JOIN 3 TABLES
SELECT TableA.*, TableB.*, TableC.*, TableD.*
FROM TableA
    JOIN TableB
        ON TableB.aID = TableA.aID
    JOIN TableC
        ON TableC.cID = TableB.cID
    JOIN TableD
        ON TableD.dID = TableA.dID
WHERE DATE(TableC.date)=date(now())

SELECT Users.*, Reviews.*, Businesses.*
FROM Reviews
  JOIN Users
    ON Users.Id = Reviews.User_id
  JOIN Businesses
    ON Businesses.Id = Reviews.Business_id;

5|Holly|Berry|1|4|It was a rager!|3|5|3|The Beagle Nightclub
7|Denzyl|George|2|5|I'd come back here again!|1|7|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
4|Steven|Wonder|3|1|Too many screaming muscleheads|7|4|7|JoeBob's Sportz Barn

(User Id, Comment, Biz Id, Reviews.user_id, Reviews.Business_id)

--------------------------
3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT Users.First_name, Businesses.Name, Reviews.Stars, Reviews.Comment
FROM Reviews
  JOIN Users
    ON Users.Id = Reviews.User_id
  JOIN Businesses
    ON Businesses.Id = Reviews.Business_id;

Holly|The Beagle Nightclub|4|It was a rager!
Denzyl|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|I'd come back here again!
Steven|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|1|Too many screaming muscleheads
--------------------------
4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

SELECT Users.*, Reviews.*, Businesses.*
FROM Reviews
  JOIN Users
    ON Users.Id = Reviews.User_id
  JOIN Businesses
    ON Businesses.Id = Reviews.Business_id
WHERE Businesses.Name = "The Beagle Nightclub"

5|Holly|Berry|1|4|It was a rager!|3|5|3|The Beagle Nightclub
6|Merryl|Streepman|4|2|The drinks were horrible!|3|6|3|The Beagle Nightclub
