# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or files. It's useful since we can access specific previous verisions later on.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing us to work without affecting the live version. Let's say 3 co-workers are working on a separate features on different branches. Once we are all done with their individual features they can merge her branch into the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in Git and records changes to the repository.
A good commit message speeds up the reviewing process. It's written in imperative tense with line breaks.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when you have commits in current branch which are not in the other branch. Some examples are if another person else edits the same file on the same lines, if someone deletes a file that another modified, and if more than one person adds a file with the same name.
